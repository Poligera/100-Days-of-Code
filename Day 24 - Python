# Getting all the names from "invited_names.txt" file and saving them as a list:
with open("./Input/Names/invited_names.txt") as names:
    names_list = names.readlines()

# Accessing the invitation and saving its contents in a "letter" variable:
with open("./Input/Letters/starting_letter.txt") as invite:
    letter = invite.read()

# Cleaning our list of names to get rid of the "\n" character:
for name in names_list:
    formatted_name = name.strip()

    # Replacing "[name]" with the actual name per invitee and saving each letter in the "Output" folder:
    with open(f"./Output/ReadyToSend/{formatted_name}_letter", "w") as personalised_letter:
        personalised_letter.write(letter.replace("[name]", formatted_name))
